# Work in progress

# This guide is used to build a Monero node using Ubuntu 16.4
# Note that all these codes are for mining Monero [XMR]

# Inital steps

# Update apt as sudo
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# Install C compiler as sudo
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Install git, make, automake, screen, libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install git make automake screen libcurl4-openssl-dev

# Download Wolf's cpu-miner from Github
cd /opt

git clone https://github.com/wolf9466/cpuminer-multi

cd cpuminer-multi

# Build cpuminer-multi
./autogen.sh

CFLAGS="-march=native" ./configure --disable-aes-ni 

make

screen -S miner ./minerd -a cryptonight -o monero pool address -u monero wallet address -p x -t 1
(The last line of code should look something like: screen -S miner ./minerd -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://xmr.crypto-pool.fr:3333 -u 492xkTA1oHfdYes8nxqAukcAemEgQmdyMXV833fuHGtfQLmk4FxH9QZLUhFvFAgNt5fjmzSC8FWfmSfHLBhdmA8oGfy6rGX -p x -t 1
Pool address is replaced by your pool's mining address and wallet address replaced by your real wallet address.
